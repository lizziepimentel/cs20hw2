			<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
			One busy July day this past summer, a group of friends had forgotten a very special birthday. One of their own -- a wimpy girl named Ellie -- had just turned 20, and none of her friends had remembered to get her a present, organize a party, or even shoot her a happy birthday text.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Once they realized, the group felt very guilty. Poor Ellie felt alone and forgotten on her big "two oh". To make it up to her, the group set up a huge party, and invited all of her friends. Next, they went to party city, stocked up on plastic recorders, and got to work.

			<br/>
			Somehow, with hours of set up and pracice, the group pulled off an amazing party the day of. And once the clock hit 11pm, the group congregated in the front and performed writers's "Happy Birthday" on their plastic recorders. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The performance was such a hit that party attendees were begging for a business card. With so much demand and not enough business preparation, the group was overwhelmed and some ventures fell through. Now, however, our information is organized within this website and you can contact or book us TODAY!
